# IIS Revision

This revision is designed to provide a concise overview of **IIS**, including both basic and some advanced concepts. It is intended especially for web developers and anyone interested in **IIS**. Let's start.

Before learning **What is IIS**, we need to understand **What is a Web Server**.

## What is the Web Server?
A web server is a specialized software that handles HTTP requests from clients (usually web browsers) and serves them web pages or resources.   
It interprets the requests and fetches the appropriate content, delivering it back to the client.

### Examples:
- Microsoft’s IIS
- Nginx
- Apache


## What is Internet Information Services (IIS)?

**IIS** is a **web server software** developed by Microsoft to host and serve websites and applications on the Windows operating system. It supports multiple protocols such as HTTP, HTTPS, FTP, and more. **IIS** is well-suited for hosting ASP.NET and .NET Core applications, and it also supports other web technologies through additional configurations.
